# nodejs-patterns
*slaps the top of repo* this bad boy can fit so many Node.js design patterns in it.

## Purpose
Provide patterns for common Node.Js conventions, focusing on taking advantage of the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/) and [EMCAScript](http://es6-features.org) features. The focus is more on providing code samples you can lift & shift into your projects, less on demonstrating individual features of Node or es6. I'll probably take these ideas & make a VSCode extension with snippets at some point in time in the future.
